* Documentation
  * Review and update all docstrings
  * Mention dependencies
* Official file extension: .lm .lmk
* Add more tests
  * Test headerless and contentless source files
  * Test very long and complex files fox maximum recursions (RuntimeError)
* * Automatic table of contents
  * Add a permalink next to headings
* * Isolate the HTML converting code in a proper class, also preparing for
    different converters like Markdown, MediaWiki...
  * Do not escape "&" when used in correct HTML entities?
  * Optionally do further HTML escapes (see Wembler's escape.py script)
* While parsing the links, prepare a report of their status (links with missing
  id's, duplicated id's...)
* Block containers must be ended by a double empty line
  But what happens if there are some nested block containers and only some of
  them need to be ended? For example:

  * item1
      * item2
      * item3


      item1's 2-indented code or root's 4-indented text?

* Parse the indentation of every line only once in a pre-processing loop?
  It would also avoid the need for rewinding etc.
* Use a centralized configuration script
* Recognize headings also when indented or children of block elements?
* Markdown compatibility mode
* * Add methods to traverse/modify the etree object
  * Allow inserting an etree into another one
* Benchmark/compare with other languages/parsers
* Support Python 2.7
